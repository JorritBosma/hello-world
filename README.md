# hello-world
This is my first repository to learn the drill.
I'm a student at the CodeGorilla Bootcamp in Groningen to become a front- and backend developer.
I have studied history and journalism with a specialization in the Middle East.
For years I have worked as a minutetaker in local politics, as a writer for magazines and as a rock accordeonist in the world famous Heavy Metal Marching Band Blaas of Glory.
I have also studied literary translation for two years in Amsterdam and have published some short stories in magazines and for the stage.
Now the time has come to make a career switch to development. The logic of programming languages is very appealing to me and I have found a lot of similarities to the way my own brain works (and how I am coping with how my brain works).
This is my first try at GitHub, in about half an hour we'll get a MasterClass but I wanted to try it myself first.
